agent-compose is an experimental control plane for running isolated agent
sessions. It provides a daemon, CLI, Connect APIs, runtime drivers, workspace
provisioning, scheduler automation, event history, and a Jupyter proxy for
notebook-style guest runtimes.

agent-compose is a public preview project: APIs, runtime packaging, deployment
defaults, and operational guidance may still change.

Chinese documentation is available at [docs/zh-CN/README.md](docs/zh-CN/README.md).

## What It Does

- Runs a long-lived daemon that owns state, scheduler execution, runtime
  lifecycle, Connect APIs, and Jupyter proxying.
- Provides a CLI for `up`, `run`, `logs`, `ps`, `down`, and image operations.
- Supports project definitions in `agent-compose.yml`.
- Starts isolated guest runtimes with Docker, BoxLite, or Microsandbox.
- Provisions workspaces from local directories or Git repositories.
- Exposes v1 session-oriented APIs and v2 project/run/image APIs.
- Includes a Svelte frontend under `frontend/`.
- Includes JavaScript runtime components under `runtime/`.

## Maturity

agent-compose is currently suitable for experimentation, local development, and
preview deployments. It is not yet a stable production platform.

Before using it with untrusted workloads, review the runtime driver behavior,
network access, authentication settings, workspace upload limits, and Jupyter
proxy assumptions.

## Requirements

- Go toolchain compatible with the version declared in `go.mod`
- Node.js and npm
- Task, for the documented `task ...` commands
- Docker, when using Docker runtime or building Docker images
- Runtime-specific dependencies for BoxLite or Microsandbox when using those
  drivers directly

## Quick Start

Build the CLI and daemon:

```bash
task build
```

Start the daemon:

```bash
agent-compose daemon
```

By default, the daemon listens on a local Unix socket. To expose an HTTP endpoint
for local development:

```bash
HTTP_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:7410 agent-compose daemon
```

Check daemon status:

```bash
agent-compose status
agent-compose --host http://127.0.0.1:7410 status
```

Create an `agent-compose.yml`:

```yaml
name: demo
agents:
  reviewer:
    provider: codex
    model: gpt-test
    image: debian:bookworm-slim
    scheduler:
      triggers:
        - name: hourly
          cron: "0 * * * *"
          prompt: "Review the current workspace state."
```

Apply and run it:

```bash
agent-compose up
agent-compose ps
agent-compose run reviewer --prompt "Review this change"
agent-compose logs --agent reviewer
agent-compose down
```

## CLI

The main commands are:

- `agent-compose daemon`: start the HTTP/Connect daemon.
- `agent-compose up`: read `agent-compose.yml` and apply the project to the daemon.
- `agent-compose run <agent>`: start a project agent run.
- `agent-compose logs`: inspect project run logs.
- `agent-compose ps`: list project agents, recent runs, and active sessions.
- `agent-compose down`: disable managed schedulers and stop running sessions.
- `agent-compose images`, `pull`, `rmi`, `image inspect`: manage daemon-side images.

Useful flags and environment variables:

- `--file, -f`: choose a compose file.
- `--project-name`: override the compose project name.
- `--json`: emit stable JSON for scripts.
- `--host` or `AGENT_COMPOSE_HOST`: connect to a TCP daemon.
- `AGENT_COMPOSE_SOCKET`: choose the local Unix socket path.

## Compose File

Top-level fields:

- `name`: project name. If omitted, the compose file directory name is used.
- `variables`: project variables with `${ENV_NAME}` interpolation.
- `workspace`: default project workspace.
- `agents`: agent definitions keyed by agent name.
- `network.mode`: currently supports `default`.

Common agent fields:

- `provider`, `model`, `system_prompt`: guest agent settings (`provider` selects
  the guest CLI runner; `model` is passed to that agent runtime). Supported guest
  providers are `codex`, `claude`, and `gemini`. Daemon-side LLM calls
  (`LLMService`, `scheduler.llm`) use `LLM_MODEL` instead.
- `image`: guest image reference.
- `driver`: runtime driver override. Supported drivers are `boxlite`, `docker`,
  and `microsandbox`.
- `env`: agent environment variables. Values may be scalars or
  `{ value, secret }` objects.
- `workspace`: agent workspace override.
- `scheduler.enabled`: defaults to `true`.
- `scheduler.triggers`: supports `cron`, `interval`, `timeout`, and `event`
  triggers.
- `scheduler.script`: inline JavaScript scheduler runtime code. Use either
  `scheduler.script` or `scheduler.triggers`, not both in the same scheduler.

Workspace providers:

```yaml
workspace:
  provider: git
  url: https://github.com/example/repo.git
  branch: main

agents:
  reviewer:
    workspace:
      provider: local
      path: .
```

## Runtime Drivers

agent-compose supports three runtime drivers:

- `docker`: the default driver. It uses Docker containers and requires a
  working Docker daemon.
- `boxlite`: uses BoxLite runtime artifacts and guest images prepared by this
  repository.
- `microsandbox`: uses Microsandbox runtime artifacts.

Image handling is selected by `IMAGE_STORE_MODE`:

- `auto`: use Docker image store when Docker is available, otherwise use the OCI
  cache.
- `docker`: require Docker image store.
- `oci`: use daemonless OCI image cache.

The default guest image is `debian:bookworm-slim` unless overridden by
`DEFAULT_IMAGE`, `DOCKER_DEFAULT_IMAGE`, or `MICROSANDBOX_DEFAULT_IMAGE`.

## Frontend

The Svelte frontend lives in `frontend/`.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:ui
npm run dev:ui
```

The daemon does not host the Web UI. Serve the built frontend with a static
server such as nginx and proxy API and Jupyter routes to the daemon. The
repository `docker-compose.yml` includes an `agent-compose-frontend` nginx
service for this layout.

For a deployment that uses published container images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up -d
```

Override `AGENT_COMPOSE_IMAGE`, `AGENT_COMPOSE_FRONTEND_IMAGE`, or
`DEFAULT_IMAGE` to pin a release tag such as `v2606.1.0` or use locally built
images. The default `latest` image tag is published by the image workflow for
release tags; main branch builds publish the `main` tag instead. The deployment
compose serves the frontend on port `80` by default; set
`AGENT_COMPOSE_HTTP_PORT` to use another host port. The default
`docker-compose.yml` remains oriented toward local development builds. Set
`AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` before exposing the deployment to a network.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local experiments.

Important variables include:

- `DATA_ROOT`: daemon data root. Session data lives under `<DATA_ROOT>/sessions`.
- `HTTP_LISTEN`: optional TCP listen address. Keep it on loopback for local
  unauthenticated development.
- `AGENT_COMPOSE_SOCKET`, `AGENT_COMPOSE_HOST`: daemon connection settings.
- `AUTH_USERNAME`, `AUTH_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_SESSION_TTL`: password
  login settings.
- `OAUTH_*`: OAuth login settings.
- `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH`: base64-encoded `username:password` for additional HTTP
  Basic authentication.
- `LLM_API_ENDPOINT`, `LLM_API_PROTOCOL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_TIMEOUT`: LLM client settings for the daemon `LLMService`
  only. These do not inject API keys into guest agent runtimes. Set
  `LLM_API_PROTOCOL=chat_completions` for OpenAI-compatible chat completions
  backends (aliases: `chat`, `chat_completion`).
- `CAP_GRPC_LISTEN`, `CAP_GRPC_TARGET`: required only when agents need to call
  OctoBus gRPC capabilities. `CAP_GRPC_LISTEN` starts the agent-compose
  capability proxy; `CAP_GRPC_TARGET` is the guest-reachable address injected
  into new sessions. After changing either value, restart the daemon and create
  a new session.
- `RUNTIME_DRIVER`: default runtime driver.
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE`, `DOCKER_DEFAULT_IMAGE`, `MICROSANDBOX_DEFAULT_IMAGE`: guest
  image defaults.
- `AGENT_COMPOSE_IMAGE`, `AGENT_COMPOSE_FRONTEND_IMAGE`: Docker Compose service
  images.
- `IMAGE_STORE_MODE`, `IMAGE_CACHE_ROOT`, `IMAGE_REGISTRY`,
  `IMAGE_INSECURE_REGISTRIES`: image store and OCI cache settings.
- `BOXLITE_HOME`, `BOXLITE_RUNTIME_DIR`, `BOX_ROOTFS_PATH`, `BOX_DISK_SIZE_GB`,
  `BOX_CACHE_TTL`: BoxLite settings.
- `DOCKER_HOME`, `DOCKER_HOST_SESSION_ROOT`: Docker runtime settings.
- `MICROSANDBOX_HOME`, `MICROSANDBOX_MSB_PATH`, `MICROSANDBOX_LIB_PATH`,
  `MICROSANDBOX_INSECURE_REGISTRIES`: Microsandbox settings.
- `GUEST_WORKSPACE`, `GUEST_STATE_ROOT`, `GUEST_RUNTIME_ROOT`,
  `GUEST_LOG_ROOT`, `JUPYTER_GUEST_PORT`: guest paths and Jupyter port.
- `WEBHOOK_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, `WORKSPACE_UPLOAD_LIMIT_BYTES`: request limits.

### Agent providers

Guest agent sessions run provider CLIs inside the guest container
(`agent-compose-runtime-js`). API keys for Codex, Claude, and Gemini must be
supplied as session or global environment variables (for example through the UI:
Settings -> Global environment variables), not only in the daemon `.env`.

| Provider | Typical env vars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or provider-specific keys in `assets/.codex/config.toml` | Uses Codex CLI/SDK in the guest image |
| `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Uses Claude Code CLI in the guest image |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Uses Gemini CLI in the guest image |

After changing guest runtime code or provider support, rebuild the guest image:

```bash
task image:agent-compose-guest
```

Create a new session (or resume one) so the updated image and environment
variables are picked up.

### Chat Completions LLM Protocol

Set `LLM_API_PROTOCOL=chat_completions` to use an OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions backend for daemon-side unary text generation. This path is used by
`LLMService.Generate` and loader `scheduler.llm` calls.

```env
LLM_API_PROTOCOL=chat_completions
LLM_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
LLM_API_KEY=...
LLM_MODEL=your-model
```

Compatible backends include DeepSeek, local OpenAI-compatible proxies
(vLLM/Ollama), and similar Chat Completions endpoints.

This does not create a workspace-capable agent session and does not grant file,
command, or MCP tool access.

With `outputSchema`, `chat_completions` uses prompt guidance and
`response_format: json_object` (not Responses API strict JSON Schema).

## Security Notes

The default configuration is designed for local development. Review and harden
settings before exposing the daemon to a network.

- Do not expose an unauthenticated daemon on a non-loopback address.
- Set a stable, high-entropy `AUTH_SECRET` when enabling authentication.
- Use HTTPS termination in production deployments.
- `HTTP_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:7410` is only appropriate behind authentication and
  network controls.
- Jupyter runs inside guest runtimes and is expected to be reached through the
  agent-compose proxy. Do not expose guest Jupyter ports directly.
- Runtime drivers may allow network access from guest workloads. Check driver
  behavior before running untrusted code.
- Treat Git credentials, uploaded workspaces, environment variables, and LLM API
  keys as secrets.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and hardening notes.

## Build And Test

```bash
task lint
task build
task test
```

Useful subcommands:

```bash
task test:unit
task test:integration
task test:e2e
task image:agent-compose-guest
task image:agent-compose
```

Runtime SDK:

```bash
cd runtime/agent-compose-runtime-sdk
npm ci
npm test
```

BoxLite-enabled binary builds are optional and require BoxLite runtime artifacts:

```bash
task build:agent-compose:boxlite
```

Scheduler runtime:

```bash
cd runtime/javascript
npm ci
npm run test:unit
```

## API Compatibility

The daemon exposes both v1 and v2 Connect APIs.

- v1 is session-oriented and remains available for existing UI and clients.
- v2 is the preferred path for newer CLI and project/run/image workflows.

Protocol definitions live under `proto/`.
