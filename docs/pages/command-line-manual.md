# agent-compose Command Line Manual

The `agent-compose` CLI connects to an agent-compose daemon and manages projects, agents, sandboxes, logs, and images. Its operating model is close to Docker Compose: a configuration file defines a project, the daemon owns long-lived state and runtime lifecycle, and the CLI applies changes, starts runs, and displays results.

## Core Concepts

- `project`: one `agent-compose.yml` or `agent-compose.yaml` defines one project. The directory containing that file is the project root.
- `agent`: an agent definition in a project. A project can define multiple agents.
- `sandbox`: a runtime isolation environment for one agent run context. An agent can have multiple sandboxes. The CLI uses the same sandbox concept whether the underlying runtime is Docker, BoxLite, or Microsandbox.
- `daemon`: the server process that owns project state, schedulers, sandbox lifecycle, logs, images, and APIs.

## Command Format

```bash
agent-compose [global options] <command> [command options] [arguments]
```

Global options are placed between `agent-compose` and the subcommand, and apply to project-related commands.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-f, --file <path>` | Path to the project config file. Both `agent-compose.yml` and `agent-compose.yaml` are supported. When this option is used, the project root is the config file directory, so you do not need to `cd` into it. |
| `--host <endpoint>` | Daemon HTTP endpoint. This can target a local daemon or a remote daemon. |
| `--project-name <name>` | Override the project name from the config file. Useful when running the same config under different environment names. |
| `--json` | Print machine-readable JSON for scripts, AI agents, and automation. |

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml up
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yaml ps --all
agent-compose --host http://10.0.0.12:7410 ls --json
```

Remote daemon authentication example:

```bash
export AUTH_USERNAME=admin
export AUTH_PASSWORD=change-me
agent-compose --host http://10.0.0.12:7410 ls
```

Rules:

- Without `-f`, the CLI looks for `agent-compose.yml` or `agent-compose.yaml` in the current directory.
- With `-f`, the CLI can operate on a project from any working directory.
- `--host` only selects the daemon. Sandboxes run in the daemon environment.
- When connecting to an HTTP(S) daemon through `--host` or `AGENT_COMPOSE_HOST`, the CLI reads Basic Auth credentials from local `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD`; local Unix socket connections do not use this authentication path.
- Automation should use `--json` and avoid parsing human-readable tables.

### Project environment files

A project can explicitly load one or more dotenv files. Relative paths are resolved from the directory containing the project config file:

```yaml
env_file:
  - .env
  - .env.local
```

Without `env_file`, the CLI first looks for `.env` in the project directory, then falls back to `.env` in the current working directory. An explicit `env_file` disables both automatic locations.

Later files override earlier files, and the environment inherited by the CLI overrides every env file. Project env files are only used to render `agent-compose.yml`; they do not change CLI connection settings such as `--host` or authentication.

## Common Workflows

Local development:

```bash
agent-compose up
agent-compose ps
agent-compose run reviewer --prompt "Review the current diff"
agent-compose logs reviewer --follow
agent-compose down
```

Daemon-managed project:

```bash
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml up
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml ps --all
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml logs --follow
```

Remote daemon:

```bash
agent-compose --host http://10.0.0.12:7410 ls
agent-compose --host http://10.0.0.12:7410 -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml up
agent-compose --host http://10.0.0.12:7410 -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml logs --follow
```

## `ls`: List Projects

List projects known to the selected daemon.

```bash
agent-compose ls
agent-compose ls --limit 20 --offset 40
agent-compose ls --verbose
agent-compose ls --json
```

Default columns:

- `PROJECT`: project name.
- `CONFIG FILE`: config file path.
- `REVISION`: current project revision. Revisions increase for each applied spec
  change; repeated applies of the current spec keep the same revision.
- `AGENTS`: agent count.
- `SCHEDULERS`: scheduler count.
- `SERVICES`: service count. The current project spec does not define a service model, so this column is shown as `-`.

`--verbose` prints additional daemon metadata, including project id, project root, spec hash, timestamps, and status summary.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--limit <n>` | Return at most `n` projects. Without this option, the CLI reads all pages. |
| `--offset <n>` | Start from an offset. Usually used together with `--limit`. |
| `--verbose` | Show additional columns. |

## `up`: Apply a Project

Read the config file and apply the project to the daemon. This starts or updates project schedulers and daemon-managed state.

```bash
agent-compose up
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml up
```

Current `up` semantics are daemon-style: the command applies the project and returns. It does not attach project logs and does not support `-d/--detach`.

## `down`: Stop a Project

Stop the current project, including schedulers, services, and running sandboxes.

```bash
agent-compose down
agent-compose -f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml down
```

Notes:

- `down` only affects the selected project.
- When using `-f` or `--project-name`, verify that the command targets the intended project.
- If some sandboxes cannot be stopped, the command exits non-zero and reports the failed items.

## `run`: Run a Sandbox

Start a sandbox for an agent, or continue work in an existing sandbox.

```bash
agent-compose run <agent> --prompt "..."
agent-compose run <agent> --command "..."
agent-compose run <agent> --sandbox <sandbox> --prompt "..."
```

Input modes:

| Mode | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | `run <agent> --prompt "..."` | Send a prompt to the agent provider. |
| command | `run <agent> --command "..."` | Start or reuse the agent sandbox and execute a shell command through guest `agent-compose-runtime exec`; stdout/stderr transcript is streamed and persisted to the run record without protocol payload markers. |
| prompt REPL | `run <agent> -i --prompt` | Read prompts line by line from stdin. Each non-empty input creates one run and reuses the same sandbox. |
| command REPL | `run <agent> -i --command` | Read commands line by line from stdin. Each non-empty input creates one run and reuses the same sandbox. |
| sandbox reuse | `run <agent> --sandbox <sandbox> --prompt "..."` | Continue in a specific sandbox. |

Prompt input must use `--prompt`, and non-interactive runs must choose `--prompt` or `--command`. Positional prompt arguments are not supported.
Additional positional arguments are not supported.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--keep-running` | Keep the sandbox runtime after the run completes. |
| `--sandbox <sandbox>` | Reuse an existing sandbox. |
| `--rm` | Remove the sandbox after the run reaches a terminal state. |
| `--jupyter` | Enable Jupyter for this run. When unset, the agent YAML default is used; when YAML is unset, Jupyter is disabled. |
| `--jupyter-expose` | Mark the Jupyter agent-compose proxy endpoint for this run as explicitly exposed. This does not request runtime-driver host port exposure and also enables Jupyter. |
| `-d, --detach` | Submit the run to the daemon and return immediately with the run id, initial status, and a `logs --follow` command. |
| `-i, --interactive` | Enter prompt or command REPL mode. Must be combined with `--prompt` or `--command`. |

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose run reviewer --prompt "Review the staged changes"
agent-compose run builder --command "task build"
agent-compose run tester --command "task test" --keep-running
agent-compose run tester --command "task test" -d
agent-compose run reviewer -i --prompt
agent-compose run tester -i --command
agent-compose run reviewer --sandbox sandbox_123 --prompt "Continue the review"
agent-compose run reviewer --jupyter --jupyter-expose --prompt "Inspect the notebook state"
```

Rules:

- Choose only one of prompt or command.
- Do not combine `--prompt` or `--command` with additional positional arguments.
- `run -d/--detach` and `run -i/--interactive` are mutually exclusive.
- `run -i/--interactive` must select `--prompt` or `--command`; it cannot be combined with `--json`.
- Empty REPL lines do not create runs. Enter `/exit` or press Ctrl+D to exit.
- REPL mode is not TTY/PTY or running stdin passthrough. Each input is one independent `RunAgentStream` call that reuses the same sandbox.
- Detached runs can be observed with the printed `agent-compose logs --run <run-id> --follow` command, or managed later with `stop` and `logs`.
- `run -i --prompt` supports providers with reusable provider conversations: Codex, Claude/cc, and OpenCode. Gemini currently returns unsupported.
- `StopRun` requests cancellation for active in-daemon runs. Pending/running runs left behind after daemon restart are reconciled to failed with a `daemon interrupted` error.

## `scheduler`: Inspect and Trigger Project Schedulers

```bash
agent-compose scheduler ls [agent]
agent-compose scheduler runs [scheduler] [--agent <agent>] [--trigger <trigger>] [--status <status>] [--limit <n>]
agent-compose scheduler logs [run] [--run <run>] [--agent <agent>] [--trigger <trigger>] [--tail <n>]
agent-compose scheduler trigger <agent> <trigger>
agent-compose scheduler inspect <name-or-id> [trigger]
```

- `scheduler ls` lists triggers from declarative scheduler config and triggers registered by scheduler scripts.
- `scheduler runs` lists scheduler runs in the current project and the sandboxes linked to each run.
- `scheduler logs` prints the structured event log for a scheduler run; without a run argument it selects the latest matching run.
- `scheduler trigger` manually runs the selected trigger through the existing project run flow.
- `scheduler trigger --prompt "..."` overrides the trigger's agent prompt for this manual run.
- `scheduler trigger --payload '{"key":"value"}'` passes a JSON payload to the scheduler trigger handler.
- `scheduler inspect` accepts a scheduler name/ID, trigger name/ID, or scheduler run ID. The legacy `<agent> <trigger>` form remains supported.

## `ps`: List Sandboxes

List sandboxes in the current project. By default, only running sandboxes are shown.
The project must already exist on the daemon; after `agent-compose down`, run `agent-compose up` again before using `ps`.

```bash
agent-compose ps
agent-compose ps -a
agent-compose ps --all
agent-compose ps --status running
agent-compose ps --status exited,error
agent-compose ps --verbose
agent-compose ps --json
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a, --all` | Show all sandboxes, including completed and errored ones. |
| `--verbose` | Show additional columns. |
| `--status <status>[,<status>...]` | Filter by sandbox status. |

Default columns:

- `SANDBOX`
- `AGENT`
- `STATUS`
- `RUN`
- `CREATED`
- `UPDATED`

`--verbose` adds project, driver, image, Jupyter, workspace, and error summary fields.

## `sandbox`: Manage Sandboxes

Use the `sandbox` command group to manage project sandboxes from a single namespace. The compatibility commands `ps`, `stop`, `resume`, and `rm` remain available.

```bash
agent-compose sandbox ls
agent-compose sandbox ls --all --json
agent-compose sandbox stop <sandbox>
agent-compose sandbox resume <sandbox>
agent-compose sandbox rm <sandbox>
agent-compose sandbox rm --force <sandbox>
agent-compose sandbox prune
agent-compose sandbox prune --older-than 7d
agent-compose sandbox prune --status error --json
agent-compose sandbox prune --agent worker --driver microsandbox --force
agent-compose sandbox prune --include-orphans
```

Subcommands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sandbox ls` | Equivalent to `ps`; supports `--all/-a`, `--status`, `--verbose`, and `--json`. |
| `sandbox stop <sandbox...>` | Equivalent to `stop`; stops one or more sandboxes. |
| `sandbox resume <sandbox...>` | Equivalent to `resume`; resumes one or more stopped sandboxes. |
| `sandbox rm <sandbox...>` | Equivalent to `rm`; removes one or more sandboxes. Use `--force` only when intentionally removing running sandboxes. |
| `sandbox prune` | Dry-run cleanup for stopped or failed sandboxes in the current project. Use `--force` to remove matched sandboxes. |

`sandbox prune` options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--status <status>[,<status>...]` | Override the default `stopped,failed` status filter. `running` and `pending` are rejected; use `sandbox rm --force <sandbox>` for running sandboxes. |
| `--agent <agent>` | Match only sandboxes for one agent name. |
| `--driver <docker|boxlite|microsandbox>` | Match only sandboxes using one runtime driver. |
| `--older-than <duration>` | Match sandboxes whose `updated_at`, or `created_at` when `updated_at` is missing, is older than a duration such as `7d` or `168h`. |
| `--include-orphans` | Also inventory daemon-wide managed runtime residue that has no sandbox record in any project. |
| `--force` | Actually remove matched sandboxes. Without this flag, `sandbox prune` is a dry-run. |

Rules:

- Without `--include-orphans`, `sandbox prune` only considers stopped or failed sandbox records in the current compose project and does not scan driver residue.
- With `--include-orphans`, `--driver` and `--older-than` filter both record and residue candidates; `--status` and `--agent` only filter records. A runtime resource associated with any known sandbox record is never an orphan.
- Ownership-incomplete, corrupt, path-escaping, active, or unknown-schema residue is displayed as non-removable and remains skipped even with `--force`.
- `sandbox prune` calls the daemon `SandboxService.PruneSandboxes` use case. It removes sandbox-owned runtime/data state, not shared cache artifacts; use `cache prune` or `cache rm` for cache inventory.
- If a forced prune fails to remove one matched sandbox, it continues with later matches, writes the skipped item, and exits non-zero.

`sandbox stop` preserves resumable driver state. `sandbox rm` writes a durable deletion journal under `<SANDBOX_ROOT>/.lifecycle`, rejects a running sandbox unless `--force` is supplied, and removes the driver resource, sandbox accessories, sandbox directory, and metadata in restart-safe stages. A sandbox in `DELETING` cannot be resumed or used for new exec/run work; daemon startup resumes only incomplete deletion journals and never guesses that an ordinary historical resource is orphaned.

## `stats`: Show Sandbox Resource Stats

Show resource stats snapshots for running sandboxes. Without a sandbox argument, the command shows all running sandboxes for the current compose project.
Project-wide stats require the project to already exist on the daemon; after `agent-compose down`, run `agent-compose up` again before using `stats` without a sandbox.

```bash
agent-compose stats
agent-compose stats --json
agent-compose stats <sandbox>
agent-compose stats <sandbox> --json
```

Fields include CPU percent, memory usage/limit/percent, network rx/tx, block read/write, uptime, driver, and sampled_at. Metrics unavailable from a runtime driver are shown as `-` in text tables. JSON keeps stable keys and represents those metrics with `value: null` and `status: unknown` or `status: unavailable`.

When a driver has no stable stats capability, the command returns unsupported instead of a generic execution failure.

## `stop`: Stop Sandboxes

Stop one or more sandboxes.

```bash
agent-compose stop <sandbox>
agent-compose stop <sandbox> [<sandbox N>]
```

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose stop sandbox_123
agent-compose stop sandbox_123 sandbox_456
```

## `resume`: Resume Sandboxes

Resume one or more stopped sandboxes.

```bash
agent-compose resume <sandbox>
agent-compose resume <sandbox> [<sandbox N>]
```

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose resume sandbox_123
agent-compose resume sandbox_123 sandbox_456
```

## `rm`: Remove Sandboxes

Remove one or more sandboxes.

```bash
agent-compose rm <sandbox>
agent-compose rm <sandbox> [<sandbox N>]
agent-compose rm --force <sandbox>
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--force` | Force removal of a running sandbox. |

Rules:

- Removing a non-running sandbox deletes its sandbox record and runtime resources.
- Removing a running sandbox without `--force` fails with an `is running` error.
- To remove a running sandbox, explicitly use `--force`. Forced removal stops the sandbox first, then removes related resources.
- Removing a sandbox does not delete the project config.

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose rm sandbox_123
agent-compose rm sandbox_123 sandbox_456
agent-compose rm --force sandbox_789
```

## `exec`: Execute in a Sandbox

Execute a command in a running sandbox, similar to `docker compose exec`.

```bash
agent-compose exec <sandbox> -- <command> [args...]
agent-compose exec <sandbox> --command "..."
agent-compose exec <sandbox> --prompt "..."
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--command "..."` | Pass a shell command as a flag. It is executed as `bash -lc "..."` in the sandbox. |
| `--prompt "..."` | Run one agent prompt in the existing sandbox and exit after the response. Add `-i` (and optionally `-t`) for a multi-turn attached session. |
| `--cwd <path>` | Set the working directory inside the sandbox. |
| `--agent <agent>` | Deprecated target selection option; use `exec <sandbox>` instead. |
| `--run <run-id>` | Deprecated target selection option; use `exec <sandbox>` instead. |

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose exec sandbox_123 -- pwd
agent-compose exec sandbox_123 -- bash -lc "task test"
agent-compose exec sandbox_123 --command "git status --short"
agent-compose exec sandbox_123 --prompt "summarize the workspace"
agent-compose exec sandbox_123 --cwd /workspace --command "pwd"
```

`exec` and `run --command` use the same guest `agent-compose-runtime exec` command output path. Text mode streams command stdout to local stdout and command stderr to local stderr after host-side marker filtering; it does not echo the host wrapper command. `--json` suppresses streaming output and prints only the final result. `exec` does not create a `ProjectRun`; use `run --command` when run audit, `logs`, or run artifacts are required.

## `logs`: Show Logs

Show logs for agents, sandboxes, or runs in the current project. By default, logs for all project agents are shown.

Current `logs` output is based on run log artifacts returned by the v2 RunService. `--follow` is served by the daemon from the log file referenced by `logs_path`; non-follow views use the run record output and artifact summary. It does not automatically read private provider log files from Codex, Claude, Gemini, or other provider CLIs.

```bash
agent-compose logs
agent-compose logs <agent>
agent-compose logs <project|agent|run|sandbox-id>
agent-compose logs --agent reviewer
agent-compose logs --run <run-id>
agent-compose logs --sandbox <sandbox>
agent-compose logs --follow
agent-compose logs -n 100
agent-compose logs -t
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-n, --tail <n>` | Show only the last `n` lines of run output. Text and JSON output use the same truncation. |
| `--follow` | Follow log output. |
| `-t, --timestamp` | Prefix text log lines with a run-level timestamp. Current output does not have per-chunk timestamps; the CLI uses the best available run timestamp. |
| `--agent <agent>` | Filter by agent. |
| `--run <run-id>` | Filter by run id. |
| `--sandbox <sandbox>` | Filter by sandbox. |

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose logs
agent-compose logs reviewer
agent-compose logs --agent reviewer --tail 200
agent-compose logs --sandbox sandbox_123 --follow -t
agent-compose logs --run run_123 --json
```

## `inspect`: Inspect Resources

Inspect project resources, daemon images, or runtime cache items.
`inspect project` and `inspect agent <agent>` require the project to already exist on the daemon; after `agent-compose down`, run `agent-compose up` again before using them.

```bash
agent-compose inspect project
agent-compose inspect <project|agent|run|sandbox|image|cache-id>
agent-compose inspect agent <agent>
agent-compose inspect run <run-id>
agent-compose inspect sandbox <sandbox>
agent-compose inspect image <image>
agent-compose inspect cache <cache-id>
```

When a full ID or hexadecimal short ID is passed as the only argument, `inspect` resolves its resource type through the daemon. Names still require the explicit typed form. Ambiguous short IDs are rejected with the matching resource types.

Details:

- `inspect project` shows project spec, revision, agents, schedulers, and related metadata.
- `inspect agent <agent>` shows agent config and runtime summary.
- `inspect run <run-id>` shows one run record.
- `inspect sandbox <sandbox>` shows sandbox/runtime details.
- `inspect image <image>` shows image details.
- `inspect cache <cache-id>` shows one daemon runtime cache item, including references, blocked reasons, and warnings.

## Image Commands

Manage images known to the daemon or referenced by the current project.

```bash
agent-compose images
agent-compose pull
agent-compose pull <image>
agent-compose rmi <image>
agent-compose inspect image <image>
```

Commands:

- `images`: list images.
- `pull`: pull all agent images referenced by the current project.
- `pull <image>`: pull a specific image. If the local OCI image backend/store already has the image, the command succeeds directly with a skipped/already exists warning and does not pull again.
- `rmi <image>`: remove an image metadata/store entry. For OCI storage this removes the logical metadata reference only; physical manifests/blobs are reclaimed explicitly by CacheService once unreferenced. It does not delete materialized or runtime-derived cache.
- `inspect image <image>`: inspect an image.

Common options:

| Command | Option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `images` | `-a, --all` | Show all images. |
| `images` | `--query <text>` | Filter by image reference. |
| `pull` | `--platform <os/arch[/variant]>` | Pull for a specific platform. |
| `rmi` | `--force` | Force image removal. |
| `rmi` | `--prune-children` | Request child-image pruning from the image backend. OCI cache currently returns a warning and does not remove blobs or runtime/materialized cache. |

## Cache Commands

List and explicitly prune daemon runtime cache inventory. The daemon is the only component that scans cache paths and performs deletion; the CLI only sends filters and displays results.

```bash
agent-compose cache ls
agent-compose cache inspect <cache-id>
agent-compose cache prune
agent-compose cache rm <cache-id>
agent-compose inspect cache <cache-id>
```

Cache domains are shown as command-level `--type` values:

- `oci`: physical manifests, blobs, and interrupted entries in the daemon OCI image store.
- `materialized`: runtime input generated from images, such as BoxLite OCI layout or Microsandbox rootfs.
- `runtime`: shared runtime-derived images under driver homes.
- `skill`: content-addressed skill artifacts and interrupted temporary/lock entries.

Protection status:

- `active`: currently used by a running/resuming runtime; never removed.
- `referenced`: has a `REQUIRED` reference, such as OCI metadata or a running/stopped sandbox dependency. It is never removable, including with `--force`. `ADVISORY` references are shown for context but do not block deletion.
- `unused`, `expired`, `orphaned`: eligible for removal when `--force` is set.
- `unknown`: reference or safety checks were incomplete; never removed.

Common options:

| Command | Option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cache ls`, `cache prune` | `--driver <docker|boxlite|microsandbox|all>` | Filter by runtime driver. |
| `cache ls`, `cache prune` | `--type <oci|materialized|runtime|skill>` | Filter by cache type. |
| `cache ls`, `cache prune` | `--status <active|referenced|unused|expired|orphaned|unknown>` | Filter by protection status. |
| `cache prune` | `--unused`, `--orphaned`, `--expired` | Status shortcuts; mutually exclusive with each other and with `--status`. |
| `cache prune` | `--older-than <duration>` | Match caches older than a duration such as `7d` or `168h`. |
| `cache prune`, `cache rm` | `--force` | Actually remove eligible items. Without `--force`, both commands are dry-run. |

Examples:

```bash
agent-compose cache ls --type materialized
agent-compose cache inspect <cache-id>
agent-compose cache prune --driver boxlite --unused
agent-compose cache prune --type skill --orphaned --force
agent-compose cache prune --expired --force
agent-compose cache prune --older-than 7d --force
agent-compose cache rm <cache-id> --force
```

`CACHE_TTL` defaults to `168h`; `0` disables expiration classification. TTL never triggers background/startup deletion. Use `cache prune --expired --force` explicitly. `--older-than` remains an independent filter. `cache prune` and `cache rm` default to dry-run; `--force` authorizes execution but never bypasses `active`, `referenced`, or `unknown` protection. BoxLite v0.9.7 runtime image inventory is read-only because its ABI has no safe image remove/prune operation; Microsandbox shared images use the SDK inventory/remove APIs. `sandbox prune` does not delete cache artifacts.

Compatibility:

- `agent-compose image ls` is deprecated; use `agent-compose images`.
- `agent-compose image pull <image>` is deprecated; use `agent-compose pull <image>`.
- `agent-compose image rm <image>` is deprecated; use `agent-compose rmi <image>`.
- `agent-compose image inspect <image>` is deprecated; use `agent-compose inspect image <image>`.
- The old `image` command tree still works and prints warnings to stderr, but it may be removed in a future release.

## `status`: Query Daemon Status

Check the selected daemon status and version.

```bash
agent-compose status
agent-compose --host http://127.0.0.1:7410 status
agent-compose status --json
```

Default columns:

- `STATUS`: daemon response status.
- `UPTIME`: daemon-reported timestamp rendered in the daemon timezone when available.
- `VERSION`: daemon build version.

Use `--json` to print the raw daemon status response for automation.

## Other Commands

```bash
agent-compose daemon
agent-compose status
agent-compose version
agent-compose config
agent-compose config --quiet
```

- `daemon`: start the agent-compose daemon.
- `status`: query daemon status.
- `version`: print the CLI build version.
- `config`: parse, validate, and print normalized project config.
- `config --quiet`: validate config without printing the normalized config.

## Deferred Commands

The following commands or capabilities are not published as stable CLI features yet:

- `build`: project image build is deferred.
- `push`: image push is deferred.
- `up -d/--detach`: current `up` already applies the project and returns; no detach flag is provided.
- Foreground `up` attach and Ctrl+C project shutdown are deferred.

## Usage Recommendations

- Use `up` to apply a project to the daemon, then use `ps` and `logs` to observe state.
- Use `-f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yml` or `-f /path/to/project/agent-compose.yaml` for cross-directory project operations.
- When operating against a remote daemon, pass `--host` explicitly and verify the target project name and config path.
- Use `--json` in scripts and automation; do not parse table layouts.
