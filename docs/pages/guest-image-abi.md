# Custom Guest Image ABI

This document defines the current minimum contract between `agent-compose` and
an OCI guest image. It also explains how to build, select, and validate a custom
image without copying every tool from the published
`ghcr.io/chaitin/agent-compose-guest` image.

The contract is capability-based. A sandbox image used only for direct command
execution needs much less software than an image that runs Codex, Claude,
Gemini, OpenCode, JupyterLab, and every supported notebook cell type.

Normative terms such as **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** describe compatibility
requirements in this document.

## 1. Compatibility Model

There is currently no guest ABI version label and no startup handshake that
proves that an arbitrary guest image matches a daemon release. The daemon
selects an image, mounts sandbox state, starts the image through a runtime
driver, and invokes commands by path and protocol convention.

Consequently:

- A custom image **MUST** be tested with every `agent-compose` release and
  runtime driver used in production.
- An image containing `agent-compose-runtime` **SHOULD** build that runtime from
  the same Git tag or commit as the daemon. The runtime CLI and its stdout
  protocols are an internal release boundary and are not guaranteed to remain
  compatible across arbitrary releases.
- The safest customization is to extend an immutable published guest tag that
  matches the daemon tag.
- A multi-architecture tag **MUST** contain the architecture used by the runtime
  host. The published matrix is `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

This contract covers the image filesystem and process environment. KVM access,
Docker reachability, image pulling, daemon privileges, network policy, model
credentials, and external service health are deployment concerns, not guest
image ABI properties.

## 2. Contract Layers

Only the baseline layer is unconditional. Add each feature layer that the
project actually uses.

| Layer | Required when | Minimum image content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox baseline | Always | Linux OCI image, root home convention, shell and bootstrap utilities, writable mount targets |
| Runtime CLI | Agent prompts, scheduler command/shell execution, or prompt attach | Node.js and a release-matched `agent-compose-runtime` executable |
| Provider | An agent selects that provider | The selected provider executable and runtime dependencies |
| Jupyter | `jupyter.enabled` or `run --jupyter` is used | Python 3 and importable `jupyterlab`; additional kernels are optional |
| Notebook cell | That cell language is executed | `bash`, `python3`, or `node`, depending on cell type |
| Runtime SDK | Workspace code installs/uses the SDK offline | Optional SDK tarball at the conventional path |

An image can therefore be compatible for direct `exec` operations while being
intentionally incompatible with agent prompts or Jupyter. Missing optional
layers fail when that capability is invoked; the daemon does not preflight all
tools during project apply.

## 3. Baseline ABI

### 3.1 Image and user

A guest image **MUST**:

- be a Linux OCI/Docker image for the target architecture;
- run as root by default (`USER root` or no non-root `USER` override);
- define `HOME=/root` and provide a real, writable `/root` directory;
- provide a writable root filesystem during sandbox startup; and
- not depend on an image `ENTRYPOINT` to initialize required files.

Non-root guest images are not currently supported. The daemon fixes its guest
home target at `/root`, mounts or symlinks provider state below `/root`, and
executes bootstrap operations that replace selected paths. There is no public
`GUEST_HOME` override.

Docker and BoxLite replace the image entrypoint and command when starting a
sandbox. Microsandbox also performs explicit post-start bootstrap. `CMD`,
`ENTRYPOINT`, `EXPOSE`, health checks, and image labels are therefore not ABI
requirements. They may still be useful when running the image by hand, but
required initialization **MUST** be baked into the image filesystem.

### 3.2 Commands required by the control plane

For all three runtime drivers, the image **MUST** provide `sh` with `-lc`
support. A cross-driver image **MUST** also provide these commands in the fixed
runtime `PATH`:

```text
mkdir  test  rm  ln  readlink  mountpoint  tail  sleep
```

These are ordinary shell/core utilities. In Debian-derived images they are
provided by packages such as `coreutils` and `util-linux`. Compatibility also
depends on the forms used by the daemon: `tail` must accept `-f`, `sleep` must
accept `infinity`, `mountpoint` must accept `-q`, and `readlink` must work on
symbolic links.

Why they are needed:

- Docker starts a non-Jupyter sandbox with `sh -lc 'tail -f /dev/null'`.
- BoxLite starts it with `sh -lc 'sleep infinity'`.
- BoxLite and Microsandbox run a `sh -lc` bootstrap that prepares `/workspace`
  and persistent home-entry symlinks and uses `mountpoint` and `readlink`.

`bash` is not needed merely to keep a basic Docker sandbox alive, but it
**MUST** be installed when using shell cells, runtime `shell` requests, the
runtime SDK `shell` API, or cross-driver Jupyter. A general-purpose custom guest
should install it.

### 3.3 Fixed command search path

For managed agent and runtime execution, `agent-compose` injects this `PATH`:

```text
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/root/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

Required executables **MUST** be installed in one of these directories, or be
addressed through a supported explicit environment variable. Do not rely on a
custom image `PATH` entry outside this list. If `agent-compose-runtime` uses the
standard `#!/usr/bin/env node` launcher, `/usr/bin/env` and `node` must also be
available through this path.

### 3.4 Filesystem and mount targets

With default daemon configuration, the guest-visible contract is:

| Guest path | Ownership and purpose | Persistence contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/workspace` | Agent cwd and project workspace | Persisted per sandbox |
| `/data/state` | Prompts, schemas, cells, provider session state, artifacts | Persisted per sandbox |
| `/data/runtime` | Runtime resources, cache, MPI, and extensions | Persisted per sandbox |
| `/data/logs` | Jupyter and runtime logs | Persisted per sandbox |
| `/root` | Image-provided real home directory | The directory itself is image-owned |
| `/root/.codex` | Codex config and state | Persisted |
| `/root/.agents` | Projected agent skills | Persisted/projected |
| `/root/.claude` | Claude config and state | Persisted |
| `/root/.opencode` | OpenCode state | Persisted |
| `/root/.gemini` | Gemini state | Persisted |
| `/root/.claude.json` | Claude root config | Persisted file |
| `/root/.gitconfig` | Git config | Persisted file |
| Selected `/root/.config/...` and `/root/.local/share/gemini` paths | Provider state | Persisted |

The daemon prepares host-side mount sources. The image **SHOULD** pre-create
`/workspace`, `/data/state`, `/data/runtime`, and `/data/logs` as directories,
but it **MUST NOT** store irreplaceable image content in those paths:

- Docker bind-mounts the logical paths individually.
- BoxLite and Microsandbox mount the whole sandbox at `/data`, hiding any
  image-native `/data` content, then replace `/workspace` with a symlink to
  `/data/workspace`.
- Only the declared home entries are persisted. Other `/root` paths remain in
  the image writable layer and are not part of the portable persistence ABI.

Additional Compose volumes may target other absolute guest paths. Those paths
are project-specific and are not part of the baseline guest ABI.

The daemon supports `GUEST_WORKSPACE`, `GUEST_STATE_ROOT`,
`GUEST_RUNTIME_ROOT`, and `GUEST_LOG_ROOT` overrides. This document defines the
default, cross-driver ABI. A deployment that changes these paths creates a
custom ABI and **MUST** validate it with every selected driver. `/root` remains
fixed.

## 4. Runtime CLI ABI

Agent prompts and managed scheduler commands do not invoke provider tools
directly. The daemon invokes `agent-compose-runtime` through `sh -lc`.

An image supporting these capabilities **MUST** provide:

- Node.js satisfying the `engines.node` range in the matching
  `runtime/javascript/package.json` (currently Node.js 20 or newer);
- an executable named `agent-compose-runtime` in the fixed `PATH`;
- the `prompt` and `exec` subcommands used by normal runs; and
- the `stream` subcommand when interactive prompt attach is required.

Prompt-mode `stream` sessions support the `codex` and `claude` providers.
Other providers are rejected before the guest runtime interaction is opened.

The daemon passes explicit workspace, state, and home paths. It also injects:

| Variable | Default/value |
| --- | --- |
| `HOME` | Inherited from the image; must be `/root` |
| `WORKSPACE` | `/workspace` |
| `STATE_ROOT` | `/data/state` |
| `RUNTIME_ROOT` | `/data/runtime` |
| `SANDBOX_ID` | Current sandbox ID |
| `VERSION` | Current daemon version |
| `AGENT_COMPOSE_RUNTIME_BASE_URL` | Set when the runtime facade is configured |

The `prompt` and `exec` stdout payloads, stream separation, artifact files, and
interactive NDJSON frames are protocol, not just CLI presentation. A custom
replacement runtime **MUST** implement the matching release protocol. Reusing
the repository runtime is strongly recommended; see
[agent-compose and runtime call contract](https://github.com/chaitin/agent-compose/blob/main/docs/design/agent-compose-runtime_contract.md).

## 5. Optional Capability Requirements

### 5.1 Agent providers

Install only the providers selected by the project. The runtime adapters and
the provider executables should come from the same repository tag's official
guest Dockerfile unless a combination has been independently tested.

| Provider | Executable/runtime requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `@openai/codex-sdk` in the runtime package plus an executable selected by `CODEX_BIN`, `AGENT_COMPOSE_CODEX_BIN`, `/usr/bin/codex`, `/usr/local/bin/codex`, or `codex` in `PATH` |
| Claude | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` plus Claude Code; use `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`/`CLAUDE_CODE_PATH`, `/usr/bin/claude`, or the SDK-supported default |
| Gemini | A `gemini` executable in `PATH` |
| OpenCode | An `opencode` executable in `PATH` |

Provider credentials and endpoint variables are injected at execution time.
They **MUST NOT** be embedded in the image.

### 5.2 Jupyter

When Jupyter is enabled, the image **MUST** provide:

- `python3`;
- an importable `jupyterlab` Python module;
- `sh`, and `/bin/bash` for the directory-only runtime launch path;
- `nohup` for background launch; and
- a writable workspace and log root.

The daemon launches `python3 -m jupyterlab` itself with the configured port,
root directory, base URL, and token. The image does not need `EXPOSE 8888`, an
image startup command, a baked token, or a Jupyter password. The default guest
port is `8888`, but it is configurable.

`bash_kernel` and the repository JavaScript kernelspec are conveniences of the
published image. They are required only if users need those kernels.

### 5.3 Notebook cells and scheduler commands

Direct cell execution uses these image commands:

| Cell/request | Required command |
| --- | --- |
| Shell cell or runtime shell request | `bash` |
| Python cell | `python3` |
| JavaScript cell | `node` |
| Runtime exec request | The command named by the request |

Likewise, MCP server commands and arbitrary `agent-compose exec` commands must
be installed by the custom image or supplied in the workspace. They are not
part of the baseline ABI.

### 5.4 Offline runtime SDK

The published guest includes:

```text
/opt/agent-compose/npm/agent-compose-runtime-sdk.tgz
```

This tarball is **not** required by the control plane or runtime CLI. Include a
release-matched tarball only when workspace Node.js code needs to install
`@chaitin-ai/agent-compose-runtime-sdk` without registry access.

## 6. What Is Not Required

The published image is a broad development environment. The baseline ABI does
not require a particular Linux distribution, `apt`, Go, a C/C++ compiler,
`grpcurl`, protobuf compilers, Git, curl, `tini`, every provider CLI, Jupyter,
extra kernels, or the offline runtime SDK.

Some of these become workload requirements. For example, Git is usually useful
to coding agents, CA certificates are needed for normal TLS access, and build
tools may be needed by a repository. Git workspace provisioning itself is
performed by the control plane before first runtime start and does not make Git
a baseline image requirement.

## 7. Recommended Build: Extend the Published Guest

This is the smallest maintenance surface and preserves all supported
capabilities:

```dockerfile
ARG AGENT_COMPOSE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z
FROM ghcr.io/chaitin/agent-compose-guest:${AGENT_COMPOSE_VERSION}

# Add only project-specific tools. Keep the default root user and paths.
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends jq rsync \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY ./company-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/company-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

Replace `vX.Y.Z` with an immutable tag or digest matching the daemon release.
Build and publish a multi-architecture image when both architectures are used:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --build-arg AGENT_COMPOSE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z \
  -f Dockerfile.guest \
  -t registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:vX.Y.Z-custom.1 \
  --push .
```

Do not place secrets, model API keys, runtime tokens, or mutable project state
in image layers.

## 8. From-Scratch Example

The following example builds a Codex-only guest from the current repository
checkout. It intentionally omits Jupyter, Python, Go, compilers, other provider
CLIs, and the offline SDK tarball. The Docker build context **MUST** be the
repository root, and `CODEX_VERSION` should match the value in the same
checkout's published guest Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-bookworm-slim

ARG CODEX_VERSION

RUN test -n "${CODEX_VERSION}" \
    && apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
         bash ca-certificates coreutils git util-linux \
    && npm install -g "@openai/codex@${CODEX_VERSION}" \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /root/.npm

COPY runtime/javascript /tmp/agent-compose-runtime

RUN cd /tmp/agent-compose-runtime \
    && npm ci \
    && runtime_tarball="$(npm pack --silent | tail -n 1)" \
    && npm install -g "./${runtime_tarball}" \
    && rm -rf /tmp/agent-compose-runtime /root/.npm

RUN mkdir -p \
      /root/.agents /root/.claude /root/.codex /root/.gemini /root/.opencode \
      /workspace /data/state /data/runtime /data/logs

ENV HOME=/root
USER root

# Helpful for direct `docker run`; agent-compose drivers replace startup
# commands with their own lifecycle command.
CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
```

Build it from the matching checkout:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg CODEX_VERSION=<version-from-guest-Dockerfile> \
  -f Dockerfile.guest \
  -t registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:custom .
```

This pattern deliberately copies runtime source instead of mixing an arbitrary
npm runtime version with the daemon. Add the optional capability dependencies
from Section 5 as needed.

## 9. Selecting the Image

Set the image on an agent:

```yaml
agents:
  reviewer:
    provider: codex
    image: registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:vX.Y.Z-custom.1
    driver:
      docker: {}
```

The same OCI image reference can be selected with BoxLite or Microsandbox on a
prepared Linux/KVM deployment. A Docker-only test does not establish
cross-driver compatibility.

To make the image the deployment default, set `DEFAULT_IMAGE` or the applicable
driver-specific default in daemon configuration. An explicit agent image takes
precedence over the default.

## 10. Validation

### 10.1 Static contract probe

Adjust the optional checks to match the intended capability set:

```bash
image=registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:custom

docker run --rm --entrypoint sh "$image" -lc '
  set -eu
  test "$(id -u)" = 0
  test "${HOME}" = /root
  test -d /root
  for command in sh mkdir test rm ln readlink mountpoint tail sleep; do
    command -v "$command" >/dev/null
  done
  for path in /workspace /data/state /data/runtime /data/logs; do
    test -d "$path"
  done

  # Runtime/Codex capability checks:
  command -v node >/dev/null
  command -v agent-compose-runtime >/dev/null
  command -v codex >/dev/null
  agent-compose-runtime --help >/dev/null
'
```

For Jupyter, also run:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh "$image" -lc '
  command -v bash >/dev/null
  command -v nohup >/dev/null
  python3 -c "import jupyterlab"
'
```

### 10.2 Repository lifecycle tests

The Docker image lifecycle smoke verifies creation, direct exec, workspace
persistence, stop/resume, and removal with the real daemon image:

```bash
task image:agent-compose

AGENT_COMPOSE_E2E_DAEMON_IMAGE=agent-compose:latest \
AGENT_COMPOSE_E2E_GUEST_IMAGE=registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:custom \
task test:e2e:image-docker
```

That smoke does not call a model provider. It proves the baseline Docker
lifecycle, not the runtime/provider layer.

If Jupyter is included, run:

```bash
AGENT_COMPOSE_E2E_DOCKER_JUPYTER_IMAGE=registry.example.com/team/agent-compose-guest:custom \
task test:e2e:docker-jupyter
```

For BoxLite or Microsandbox, run `task test:runtime-smoke` only on a prepared
Linux/KVM host, then perform a real project run with the custom image. Provider
acceptance should include at least one real prompt for every installed provider
and should verify resume/session state if that behavior is relied upon.

## 11. Upgrade Checklist

For every daemon upgrade:

1. Rebase the custom image on the matching published guest tag, or rebuild
   `runtime/javascript` from the matching source tag.
2. Reconcile provider CLI versions with
   `guest-images/Dockerfile.agent-compose-guest`.
3. Re-run the static probe and Docker lifecycle tests.
4. Re-run Jupyter, provider, and selected-driver acceptance tests for enabled
   capabilities.
5. Publish an immutable tag or digest and update project/deployment references
   deliberately; do not silently move a production compatibility tag.
