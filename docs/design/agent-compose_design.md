# agent-compose Architecture

Chinese version: [../zh-CN/design/agent-compose_design.md](../zh-CN/design/agent-compose_design.md)

This document describes the agent-compose architecture currently implemented in
the codebase, including the daemon and CLI design that has already landed.
Earlier refactoring plans, phase plans, and acceptance checklists are no longer
kept as design documents.

The current code facts are anchored by these entry points:

- CLI and daemon entrypoint: `cmd/agent-compose/main.go`
- Daemon service registration: `pkg/agentcompose/service.go`
- Compose parsing and normalization: `pkg/compose/`
- v1 API: `proto/agentcompose/v1/agentcompose.proto`
- v2 API: `proto/agentcompose/v2/agentcompose.proto`
- Project/run persistence: `pkg/agentcompose/project_schema.go` and
  `pkg/agentcompose/project_store.go`
- Jupyter proxy: `pkg/agentcompose/proxy.go`
- Loader runtime and scheduling: `pkg/agentcompose/loader_engine.go` and
  `pkg/agentcompose/loader_manager.go`
- Standalone frontend image: `nginx/Dockerfile`

## Architecture Goals

agent-compose is an agent/session control plane. Its shape is similar to Docker
Engine + CLI + Compose, while keeping its own domain model for agents,
scheduler, workspaces, runtime drivers, and notebook proxying.

Core boundaries:

- The daemon is the state authority. It owns persistence, scheduler execution,
  runtime lifecycle, Connect APIs, HTTP APIs, and Jupyter proxying.
- The CLI is a daemon client. It reads local `agent-compose.yml`, performs local
  syntax validation and normalization, calls daemon APIs, and renders output.
- `agent-compose.yml` describes projects and agent definitions. It does not
  describe an already running session.
- Web/UI is no longer built into the daemon image or hosted by the daemon
  process. It is deployed as an independent frontend service.
- The v1 session-centric API remains available for the existing Web/UI and
  compatibility clients. The v2 API is the primary path for the CLI and newer
  clients.

```

## Process And Transport

`cmd/agent-compose/main.go` uses Cobra to provide a single binary with multiple
subcommands. Running the binary without a subcommand still starts the daemon,
but explicit daemon startup is recommended:

```bash
agent-compose daemon
```

Daemon construction has been split into testable app construction:

- Load `.env` and environment configuration.
- Initialize Echo, structured logging, and DI.
- Register `/api/version`, v1/v2 Connect handlers, webhook/event routes,
  workspace HTTP routes, and Jupyter proxy routes.
- Inject optional global BasicAuth from `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH`.
- Register the service graph through `agentcompose.Register(di)`.
- Start the loader manager, event dispatcher, capability proxy, and startup
  session reconciliation through `agentcompose.StartBackground(di)`.
- On graceful shutdown, close all listeners and remove the Unix socket file.

The daemon listens on a Unix socket by default:

- `AGENT_COMPOSE_SOCKET` is used when explicitly set.
- Otherwise `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agent-compose.sock` is preferred.
- Otherwise `/tmp/agent-compose-<uid>.sock` is used.

A TCP HTTP/Connect listener is enabled only when `HTTP_LISTEN` is explicitly
set. CLI connection priority is `--host`, then `AGENT_COMPOSE_HOST`, then the
default Unix socket.

```bash
HTTP_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:7410 agent-compose daemon
agent-compose --host http://127.0.0.1:7410 status
```

## CLI Semantics

The CLI does not directly manipulate runtime state, session files, or SQLite
reconciliation logic. It reads and normalizes the local compose file, then calls
daemon v2 APIs.

Current main commands:

- `config`: parse and normalize local `agent-compose.yml`; supports `--json`
  and `--quiet`; does not connect to the daemon.
- `up`: call `ProjectService.ApplyProject`; create or update the project,
  revision, managed agent definitions, and scheduler/loader; does not directly
  create a run or session.
- `down`: call `ProjectService.RemoveProject`; disable managed
  scheduler/loader and stop running sessions for the project; preserves project,
  run, and session history by default.
- `ps`: query project, agent, latest run, and running session state.
- `run <agent>`: call `RunService.RunAgentStream` for a manual agent run;
  creates a new session by default, supports reusing an existing session with
  `--session-id`, stops the runtime after completion by default, and can keep it
  running with `--keep-running`.
- `logs`: inspect run output by project, agent, run id, or session id; supports
  `--follow`.
- `exec`: call `ExecService.ExecStream` inside a running session; can locate the
  target by session id, run id, or project/agent selector.
- `images`, `image ls`, `pull`, `image pull`, `rmi`, `image rm`,
  `image inspect`: call `ImageService` to manage the daemon image store. The
  default store is selected by daemon `IMAGE_STORE_MODE`.
- `inspect <project|agent|run|session>`: inspect project-related objects.

## `agent-compose.yml` Model

Compose parsing lives in `pkg/compose`. The normalized output is used for local
`config` output, spec hashing, and daemon apply.

Example:

```yaml
name: review-project

variables:
  OPENAI_API_KEY:
    value: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    secret: true

workspace:
  provider: git
  url: https://github.com/org/repo.git
  branch: main

agents:
  reviewer:
    provider: codex
    model: gpt-5
    image: ghcr.io/org/agent-runtime:latest
    driver:
      boxlite:
        kernel: s3://bucket/kernel
    env:
      REVIEW_MODE: strict
    scheduler:
      enabled: true
      triggers:
        - name: hourly
          cron: "0 * * * *"
          prompt: "Review the latest workspace state."
        - event:
            topic: git.push
          prompt: "Review changes from the incoming event."

network:
  mode: default
```

The same scheduler can also declare a loader script directly with inline QJS:

```yaml
agents:
  reviewer:
    provider: codex
    image: ghcr.io/org/agent-runtime:latest
    scheduler:
      script: |
        scheduler.interval("hourly-review", function hourlyReview() {
          return scheduler.agent("Review the latest workspace state.");
        }, 3600000);

        function main(payload) {
          return { ok: true, payload };
        }
```

Normalization rules:

- If `name` is empty, it is derived from the compose file directory.
- Agent map keys must be stable identifiers. Output is sorted by agent name.
- Driver is a one-of shape: `boxlite`, `docker`, or `microsandbox`. When
  omitted, the default is `docker`.
- `firecracker` may appear in the schema, but current normalization returns
  unsupported.
- Empty `network` or `mode: default` is accepted. Other network modes return
  unsupported.
- Triggers support `cron`, `interval`, `timeout`, and `event`. Each trigger must
  specify exactly one type.
- `scheduler.script` is an inline QJS scalar saved into the managed loader
  `script` field. Blank scripts are treated as unset.
- `scheduler.script` and non-empty `scheduler.triggers` are mutually exclusive.
  `scheduler.script_file`, `import` / `require`, and bundling are not currently
  supported.
- `${NAME}` is read from the CLI process environment or explicitly injected
  environment. Missing variables produce field-path errors. Empty variable values
  are valid.
- Values marked `secret: true` participate in the normalized spec and hash, but
  are redacted in YAML/JSON display output.
- The spec hash is computed from canonical JSON and is insensitive to YAML/JSON
  field ordering.

Workspace providers currently supported during project run preparation:

- `local`: materialize a relative path under the project source path into a file
  workspace snapshot.
- `git`: generate a Git workspace config that is later cloned by existing
  workspace provisioning.

## API Boundaries

### v1 Connect API

The v1 API is the stable interface for the existing Web/UI and compatibility
clients. The daemon currently registers:

- `SessionService`
- `KernelService`
- `AgentService`
- `AgentDefinitionService`
- `LLMService`
- `ConfigService`
- `LoaderService`
- `DashboardService`
- `CapabilityService`

v1 still covers session, cell, agent event, global env, workspace config,
loader, dashboard overview, and capability management.

### v2 Connect API

The v2 API is for project/run/image/exec workflows:

- `ProjectService`
  - `ValidateProject`
  - `ApplyProject`
  - `GetProject`
  - `ListProjects`
  - `RemoveProject`
  - `WatchProject` is currently covered only by an unimplemented handler.
- `RunService`
  - `RunAgent`
  - `RunAgentStream`
  - `GetRun`
  - `ListRuns`
  - `StopRun`
- `ExecService`
  - `Exec`
  - `ExecStream`
- `ImageService`
  - `ListImages`
  - `PullImage`
  - `InspectImage`
  - `RemoveImage`

`RemoveProject(remove_history=true)` currently returns unimplemented. The
default `down` semantics preserve history. `ImageService` supports both Docker
daemon store and OCI cache store; when request store is `UNSPECIFIED`, the
daemon image store mode selects the backend.

v2 `ProjectSpec` is the wire shape used by CLI and API clients to pass the
current compose state. `AgentSpec.scheduler` contains:

- `enabled`
- declarative `triggers`
- inline QJS `script`

When the server receives a v2 `ProjectSpec`, it first converts it back to the
compose YAML shape, then runs the same parse/normalize rules in `pkg/compose`.
`ProjectSpecResponse` also returns the normalized `scheduler.script` to CLI and
API responses. This keeps local `config`, CLI `up`, `ValidateProject`, and direct
v2 API calls on the same field rules, mutual-exclusion rules, and spec hash
calculation.

### HTTP Routes

Besides Connect APIs, the daemon registers these HTTP routes:

- `/api/version`
- webhook / event ingress: `/api/webhooks/:topic`, `/api/events...`
- file workspace helper routes:
  `/api/agent-compose/workspaces/:workspaceID/files`, `upload`, and `download`
- Jupyter proxy: `<JupyterProxyBasePath>/:sessionID` and
  `<JupyterProxyBasePath>/:sessionID/*`. The default base path is `/jupyter`.

The Jupyter proxy implementation lives in `pkg/agentcompose/proxy.go`.
`GetSessionProxy` returns only proxy entry information; actual HTTP/WebSocket
forwarding is handled by the HTTP routes above. When a session is created,
`Config.JupyterProxyBasePath` is written into `proxyPath`; the current code
default is `/jupyter`.

## Project Apply And Scheduling

A project is the persisted daemon-side instance of `agent-compose.yml`. Project
id, managed agent id, scheduler id, loader id, and run id are generated by
stable rules.

Current `ApplyProject` behavior:

- Validate and normalize the v2 `ProjectSpec`.
- Persist project revision idempotently by spec hash. Applying the same spec
  repeatedly does not create duplicate revisions.
- Write `project_agent`.
- Reconcile each agent spec into a managed `AgentDefinition`, isolated from
  manual agent definitions by `managed_project_id`, `managed_project_revision`,
  and `managed_agent_name`.
- Compile scheduler definitions into managed Loader/Trigger records.
  Declarative `scheduler.triggers` generate a managed loader script. Inline
  `scheduler.script` is used directly as the managed loader script, and triggers
  returned from loader validation are written to `loader_trigger` and
  `ProjectScheduler.trigger_count`.
- Delete or disable schedulers removed from the spec, then refresh the loader
  manager.
- Do not directly create runs or sessions.
- Return `issues` on reconcile failure and avoid leaving half-created enabled
  schedulers that would continue triggering broken agents.

Managed resources modify only agent definitions, loaders, and triggers that
carry managed metadata. Manual resources with the same names are not overwritten
or deleted.

`ValidateProject` and `ApplyProject` use the same scheduler construction path.
Declarative schedulers only receive compose and loader trigger structure
validation. Inline QJS schedulers call existing
`LoaderManager.Validate(ctx, "scheduler", script)`, where the QJS loader engine
evaluates the script and collects triggers registered through
`scheduler.interval`, `scheduler.timeout`, `scheduler.on`, and
`scheduler.cron`. Syntax errors, duplicate trigger ids, and invalid
timer/cron/event parameters are converted into project validation issues at the
path `agents.<name>.scheduler.script`.

Reconcile order is conservative: stage `ProjectScheduler` and managed `Loader`
as disabled, replace loader triggers, then enable the loader and scheduler. If
trigger replacement or enablement fails, cleanup runs to avoid leaving an
enabled scheduler whose trigger/script state is inconsistent.

## Run Execution Pipeline

A run is a single agent execution record. It can come from CLI manual run,
scheduler trigger, or future API clients.

`RunService.RunAgent` and `RunAgentStream` share the same coordinator path:

1. Resolve project agent and managed agent definition by project id + agent
   name.
2. Create a pending `project_run` record, storing source, scheduler/trigger,
   prompt, driver, image, and related metadata.
3. Merge runtime environment. Priority from low to high is global env, project
   variables, agent env, then run request env.
4. Prepare local/Git workspace snapshot from project/agent workspace spec.
5. Create a new session or reuse an existing session with `--session-id`.
6. Write project, agent, run_id, scheduler_id, source, and related tags to the
   session.
7. Mark run as running and call the existing agent executor.
8. Stream start/output/completed events for streaming requests.
9. Persist terminal run state for success, failure, cancellation, workspace
   preparation failure, session startup failure, agent execution failure, and
   stream send failure.
10. Stop the runtime by default while preserving session/run history. The
    `KEEP_RUNNING` cleanup policy keeps the session running.

State queries primarily use project/run relationships in SQLite. Session tags
are used for compatibility queries, `down` stopping project sessions, and
file-level debugging.

### Agent system prompt (Phase 1)

`AgentDefinition.system_prompt` is persisted on agent definitions (manual and
managed) and exposed through v1/v2 APIs and the Agents UI. At execution time the
host resolves this field and materializes agent identity for the guest runtime.

Layered prompt model:

1. **Agent Identity** — per-agent `system_prompt` (omitted when empty)
2. **Capabilities (MPI)** — OctoBus capset catalog under `runtime/mpi/catalog.md`
3. **Per-turn task** — user message in `--message-file` (never mixed with identity)

Transport uses a **fixed convention path** under the session state tree:

```text
<session>/state/agents/system-prompts/system-prompt.txt  →  guest /data/state/agents/system-prompts/system-prompt.txt
```

Resolution paths:

- Managed project runs: `RunService` passes `run.ManagedAgentID` into
  `ExecuteAgentRequest`
- Loader runs: `loaderRunHost.Agent` passes the loader-bound agent definition id
- Session chat: session tags `source=agent` and `agent_id`

The guest JS runtime (`runtime/javascript`) reads the convention file from
`--state-root`, composes identity + MPI via `buildSystemContext`, and injects the
result into Codex `developer_instructions`, Claude `systemPrompt.append`, or
Gemini user prompt prepend.

See [agent_system_prompt_design.md](agent_system_prompt_design.md) and
[agent-compose-runtime_contract.md](agent-compose-runtime_contract.md) for
the full contract.

## Command Execution And Images

`ExecService` does not create sessions. It executes commands only inside an
existing running session. Target lookup can use:

- explicit `session_id`
- explicit `run_id`, then the associated run session
- project/agent selector, which must uniquely match a running session

The default cwd is the guest workspace path `/workspace`, and requests may
override it.

`ImageService` currently has three backend entry points:

- `ListImages` supports reference query, `--all`, and pagination.
- `PullImage` supports platform.
- `InspectImage` returns image details.
- `RemoveImage` supports force and prune children.

Store selection rules:

- Request store `DOCKER_DAEMON` forces Docker daemon.
- Request store `OCI_CACHE` forces daemonless OCI cache.
- Request store `UNSPECIFIED` uses `IMAGE_STORE_MODE`: `docker` forces Docker,
  `oci` forces OCI cache, and `auto` briefly probes Docker daemon, using Docker
  when available and OCI cache otherwise.

OCI cache uses `pkg/imagecache` and go-containerregistry to pull images from a
registry. It does not depend on dockerd, containerd, or Podman. `PullImage` uses
go-containerregistry `remote.Image`, the default keychain, platform selector,
and configured insecure registry list. When platform is not specified, daemon
platform is used. OCI cache stores metadata, OCI Image Layout, BoxLite
materialized layout, and Microsandbox rootfs. OCI image proto fields include
`Store=OCI_CACHE`, `Oci` metadata, repo tags/digests, manifest/config digest,
platform, size, labels, and store status.

OCI cache query and deletion semantics keep the v2 API shape consistent with the
Docker backend, but status comes from cache metadata:

- `ListImages` query matches requested ref, normalized ref, repo tag, repo
  digest, manifest digest, config digest, and cache key, and supports substring
  filtering.
- `InspectImage` uses the same lookup keys. Digest lookup ignores differences in
  `sha256:` prefix form.
- `RemoveImage` deletes only the matched metadata ref by default. When the same
  image identity has multiple refs, `force` is required. `prune_children` does
  not remove blobs in OCI cache and returns a warning. Blob cleanup is left to a
  dedicated future mechanism; current deletion is conservative metadata deletion.
- Not found, invalid reference, conflict, internal, and unavailable errors map
  to stable Connect codes. Error messages retain operation, image ref, and cache
  endpoint.

For `up/run`, the `docker` driver ensures the required image is available.
`boxlite` and `microsandbox` project/run preparation does not fail just because
Docker daemon is unavailable. When starting runtimes, they use Docker-first image
resolution: when Docker daemon is available, local Docker materialization is
reused; when Docker is unavailable or the Docker image is missing, OCI cache is
used. BoxLite consumes OCI layout and Microsandbox consumes extracted rootfs.
Docker runtime does not consume OCI cache directly.

## Storage Model

Default data root:

- If `DATA_ROOT` is empty, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/agent-compose` is used.
- If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is empty, `$HOME/.local/share/agent-compose` is used.
- `SESSION_ROOT` is `<DATA_ROOT>/sessions`.
- If `IMAGE_CACHE_ROOT` is empty, it is `<DATA_ROOT>/images`.

Image store configuration:

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IMAGE_STORE_MODE` | `auto` | Default store selection mode for `UNSPECIFIED` ImageService requests. Valid values: `auto`, `docker`, `oci`. |
| `IMAGE_CACHE_ROOT` | `<DATA_ROOT>/images` | Daemonless OCI cache root. Stores metadata and OCI Image Layout. Runtime materialization directories live beside this root under `image-cache/`. |
| `IMAGE_INSECURE_REGISTRIES` | empty | Insecure registry host list for OCI cache pulls. Supports comma, semicolon, or newline separators and trims each item. |
| `IMAGE_REGISTRY` | `docker.io` | Default registry for unqualified image references. Also used by runtime smoke default image resolution. |

Typical layout:

```text
data/agent-compose/
├── data.db
├── images/
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── oci/
├── image-cache/<image-id>/
│   ├── oci/
│   └── rootfs/
└── sessions/<session_id>/
    ├── metadata.json
    ├── workspace/
    ├── context/
    ├── home/
    ├── runtime/
    ├── state/
    │   ├── cells.json
    │   └── events.json
    ├── logs/
    ├── vm/
    │   └── runtime.json
    └── proxy/
        └── jupyter.json
```

The session directory stores session metadata, workspace, home backing, runtime
shared directory, cell/event timeline, VM state, and proxy state. By default,
`images/` is the OCI cache root; `image-cache/<image-id>/oci` is the BoxLite
materialized OCI layout, and `image-cache/<image-id>/rootfs` is the Microsandbox
materialized rootfs.

`DATA_ROOT/data.db` currently stores:

- global env
- workspace config
- agent definition
- loader / loader trigger / loader binding
- loader run / loader event
- webhook topic event
- project / project_revision / project_agent / project_scheduler / project_run

Project-related tables:

- `project`
- `project_revision`
- `project_agent`
- `project_scheduler`
- `project_run`

Managed agent definitions and loaders are isolated through managed metadata
columns on existing tables:

- `managed_project_id`
- `managed_project_revision`
- `managed_agent_name`
- `managed_scheduler_id`, loader only

## Session And Runtime

Session is the low-level runtime lifecycle unit. Three runtime drivers are
currently supported:

- `boxlite`
- `docker`
- `microsandbox`

The default driver is controlled by `RUNTIME_DRIVER`; when empty, it is
`docker`. The default guest image is `debian:bookworm-slim`.

Current `CreateSession` flow:

1. Resolve env, tags, workspace id, driver, and guest image from the request.
2. Merge global env and request env.
3. Create the session directory and initialize metadata, VM state, and proxy
   state.
4. If workspace id is set, prepare that workspace.
5. Start runtime through the driver.
6. Mark session as `RUNNING`.
7. Record `session.created` event and publish `agent-compose.session.created`
   topic event.

`ResumeSession` prepares workspace again and starts runtime. On success, it
records `session.resumed` and publishes the corresponding topic event.
`StopSession` stops runtime, marks the session `STOPPED`, records
`session.stopped`, and publishes the corresponding topic event.

Startup reconciles persisted session runtime state. `GetSession`,
`ListSessions`, and `StopSession` also trigger reconciliation logic.

Default guest paths:

| Host path | Guest path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<session>/workspace` | `/workspace` | Jupyter root, cell/agent/command cwd |
| `<session>/state` | `/data/state` | Cell artifacts, agent prompt, provider state |
| `<session>/runtime` | `/data/runtime` | Runtime shared resources |
| `<session>/logs` | `/data/logs` | Jupyter logs |
| `<session>/home` or child paths | `/root` or child paths | Tool config and state for Codex, Claude, Gemini, git, and related tools |

For the more detailed mount manifest design, see
[runtime_mount_manifest_design.md](runtime_mount_manifest_design.md) and
[runtime_mount_manifest_driver_specific_design.md](runtime_mount_manifest_driver_specific_design.md).

## Loader Runtime

The current loader runtime is `scheduler`, supporting:

- `interval`
- `timeout`
- `event`
- `cron`

Project compose `scheduler.script` uses the same runtime. Scripts are evaluated
during validate/apply to collect triggers. APIs with side effects or host
dependencies, such as `scheduler.agent`, `scheduler.llm`, `scheduler.exec`,
`scheduler.shell`, `scheduler.event.publish`, and session RPC, should be used in
`main()` or trigger callbacks.

`scheduler` is the only product-level global object in the loader QJS
environment. Its responsibilities are trigger registration, lightweight state,
event publishing, and delegating work that needs sandbox capabilities to runtime
sessions. The QJS layer is not intended to host complex Node.js workflows, npm
dependencies, or long-running business logic.

When full Node.js capabilities are needed, the current implementation calls
workspace scripts inside the loader session through `scheduler.exec` /
`scheduler.shell`, or uses existing agent and LLM capabilities through
`scheduler.agent` / `scheduler.llm`. Standalone `scheduler.run(file, input,
options)`, runtime workflow context, workflow bridge token, and an
`agent-compose-runtime workflow` subcommand are not part of the current API
contract. Design documents should not present those draft interfaces as
implemented capabilities.

`LoaderManager.Start()` starts the schedule loop and event loop during daemon
background startup.

Main JavaScript APIs:

- `scheduler.log(message, payload)`
- `scheduler.agent(prompt, options)`
- `scheduler.llm(prompt, options)`
- `scheduler.state.get(key)`
- `scheduler.state.set(key, value)`
- `scheduler.state.delete(key)`
- `scheduler.exec(request)`
- `scheduler.shell(script, options)`
- `scheduler.event.publish(topic, payload)`
- `scheduler.interval(...)`
- `scheduler.timeout(...)`
- `scheduler.on(...)`
- `scheduler.cron(...)`

`scheduler.agent` and `scheduler.llm` support `outputSchema` / `schema`. Passing
a `scheduler.z` schema generates JSON Schema and validates the returned value
locally. Passing plain JSON Schema performs JSON parsing.

### Daemon LLM client

`scheduler.llm`, `LLMService.Generate`, and SDK `runtime.llm` delegate to
`LLMClient` in the Go daemon. Configuration is daemon-global:

- `LLM_API_ENDPOINT`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`,
  `LLM_TIMEOUT`
- `LLM_API_PROTOCOL`: `responses` (default, OpenAI Responses API) or
  `chat_completions` (OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions; aliases: `chat`,
  `chat_completion`)

Global env from the UI/database overrides process environment for these keys.
The `chat_completions` protocol is for unary text generation only. It does not
create workspace-capable agent sessions or grant file, command, or MCP tool
access. With `outputSchema`, it uses prompt guidance and `json_object` instead
of Responses API strict JSON Schema.

Guest agent providers (`codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `opencode`) remain separate CLI runners
inside guest containers with their own API keys and session state.

The loader also exposes a unary RPC bridge for v1 `SessionService`:

- `scheduler.session.createSession(request)`
- `scheduler.session.resumeSession(request)`
- `scheduler.session.stopSession(request)`
- `scheduler.session.getSession(request)`
- `scheduler.session.listSessions()`
- `scheduler.session.getSessionProxy(request)`

Method names use lower camel case and also retain original proto method aliases,
for example `scheduler.session.ResumeSession(...)`.

## Frontend Service

The daemon does not host Web/UI static assets and no longer supports
`HTTP_ROOT` / `UI_ROOT` static-root configuration. The daemon main process only
registers API, Connect, webhook/workspace, and Jupyter proxy routes.

The current Docker deployment provides an independent frontend service:

- `nginx/Dockerfile` builds `agent-compose-frontend`.
- Compose has two services: `agent-compose` daemon and
  `agent-compose-frontend`.
- The frontend service serves `frontend/` build output and reverse proxies the
  daemon v1/v2 Connect APIs, `/api/`, and Jupyter proxy routes.

For shared playground build, deployment, and verification flow, see
[playground_setup.md](playground_setup.md).

## Key Constraints

- The daemon is the state and reconciliation authority. The CLI does not write
  SQLite or session files directly.
- `agents.<name>` is an agent definition, not a resident runtime.
- `up` manages definitions and scheduler. It is not the same as running an
  agent.
- `run` is a one-shot execution. It stops runtime by default after completion.
- `down` disables managed scheduler/loader and stops running project sessions.
  It does not delete history by default.
- The v1 API must remain compatible. The v2 API carries the primary
  project/run/exec/image path.
- Web/UI is deployed as an independent service and is not included in the daemon
  Docker image.
