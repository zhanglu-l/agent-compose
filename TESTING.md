# Testing Standards

This project measures test coverage through three complementary test shapes:
unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Coverage standards apply to
project code across the Go services, runtime components, and frontend/runtime
JavaScript or TypeScript code.

## Test Shapes

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify isolated functions, types, and small modules without requiring
external services, runtime sandboxes, Docker, network access, or persistent
shared state.

Unit tests should:
- be deterministic and fast
- use fakes, stubs, or in-memory stores where practical
- cover edge cases, validation, serialization, scheduling logic, and error paths
- avoid depending on test execution order

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify collaboration between multiple project components or
between project code and controlled local dependencies.

Integration tests may use:
- local files, temporary databases, and temporary session roots
- in-process HTTP or Connect handlers
- local runtime-driver adapters when they can be exercised deterministically
- controlled Docker or sandbox dependencies when explicitly marked and isolated

Integration tests should prove that service boundaries, persistence, proxying,
configuration, loader scheduling, and runtime-driver interactions work together.

### E2E Tests

E2E tests verify complete user-facing workflows through the deployed service or
a production-like local service instance.

E2E tests should cover critical workflows such as:
- creating, resuming, stopping, and proxying sessions
- executing notebook or kernel actions through the public API surface
- loader trigger and run workflows
- frontend flows that depend on generated protocol clients
- authentication and configuration workflows where applicable

E2E tests should be isolated, repeatable, and explicit about required runtime
dependencies.

## Quality Gate

`task test` is the project quality gate for tests.

The `test` task in `Taskfile.yml` must calculate and print:
- unit-test coverage
- integration-test coverage
- E2E-test coverage
- total combined coverage

Coverage output must be visible in normal task output and suitable for CI logs.
The task should fail when any required coverage baseline is not met.

Combined coverage is the merged coverage achieved by all three test shapes over
the same project coverage scope. It must not be calculated as a simple average
of unit, integration, and E2E percentages. When a line, branch, function, or
statement is covered by more than one test shape, it should count once in the
combined coverage result.

Generated protocol clients, vendored code, build artifacts, and test fixtures
should be excluded from coverage calculations unless the project intentionally
treats them as maintained source code. Any exclusions must be documented in the
coverage tooling or the `test` task implementation.

## Coverage Baselines

Minimum required coverage:
- unit tests: at least 65%
- integration tests: at least 65%
- E2E tests: at least 65%
- total combined coverage: at least 75%

Recommended coverage targets:
- unit tests: at least 80%
- integration tests: at least 70%
- E2E tests: at least 65%
- total combined coverage: at least 75%

The required baselines are release-blocking. The recommended targets are the
preferred engineering standard for new and substantially changed code.

## Reporting Expectations

Coverage reports should make it clear which test shape produced each coverage
number and which source-code scope was measured. When coverage cannot be
calculated for a test shape, `task test` should fail rather than silently omit
that number.

When adding a feature or fixing a bug, choose the narrowest test shape that
proves the behavior, then add broader integration or E2E coverage when the
change crosses service boundaries, persistence boundaries, runtime-driver
behavior, or user-facing workflows.
